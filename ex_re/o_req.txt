Internal Opinion Request
From: Jane Doe, Business Development Manager
To: Legal Department (John Smith, Senior Counsel)
Date: April 15, 2024

Subject: Request for Legal Opinion on Proposed Partnership Agreement with XYZ Corp.

Background:
Our company, ABC Enterprises, is in the final stages of negotiations with XYZ Corp. to establish a new business partnership that will allow us to expand our product line into new international markets. XYZ Corp. has provided a draft partnership agreement, which includes clauses related to intellectual property rights, non-compete provisions, and dispute resolution mechanisms. However, there are concerns regarding the potential legal risks, especially related to intellectual property protection and the non-compete clauses, which may be overly restrictive.

Request:
Please review the attached draft partnership agreement and provide your legal opinion on the following points:

Are there any clauses in the agreement that could expose ABC Enterprises to unnecessary legal risk or liabilities?
Specifically, do the intellectual property provisions adequately protect our proprietary assets, or are there any areas where we may be vulnerable?
Do the non-compete clauses present any legal concerns, particularly with respect to enforceability in the jurisdiction where the partnership will be established?
Are there any recommendations for amendments or revisions to the agreement to better align with our company's legal and business interests?

Deadline for Opinion:
Please provide your opinion by December 25, 2024, as we are scheduled to finalize the partnership agreement by the end of the month.
