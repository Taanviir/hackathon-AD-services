# Hackathon-AD-Services

## üìã Overview
This project aims to develop solutions that streamline and enhance internal processes for Abu Dhabi government departments. The focus is on solving two key challenges related to internal opinion requests and research/benchmarking tasks. Our proposed solutions seek to improve efficiency, reduce duplication of effort, and standardize workflows.

## üöÄ Challenges

### Challenge 1: Streamlining Internal Opinion Request Processes

#### Problem Description
The current process for handling Internal Opinion Requests is fragmented and inefficient, resulting in:

- **Inconsistent Responses**: Different departments provide opinions in varying formats and quality levels, making it hard to consolidate feedback.
- **Duplicated Efforts**: Multiple departments may independently analyze the same documents, leading to redundant work.
- **Lack of Standardization**: Each department uses its own format for analyses and recommendations, making comparisons difficult.

#### Solution Sought
A unified system that:

- Standardizes response formats across all departments.
- Reduces redundancy by leveraging shared knowledge and past analyses.
- Improves efficiency by centralizing the entire process.

#### Example Solution
An internal opinion request platform that:

- Automates task assignment based on departmental expertise.
- Provides standardized templates for responses.
- Includes a shared knowledge base to access previous analyses and avoid duplication.

### Challenge 2: Automating & Centralizing Research and Benchmarking for Key Topics

#### Problem Description
Teams currently spend excessive time on manual research for key topics, leading to:

- **Manual Research**: Time-consuming searches through news articles, industry reports, and statistics websites.
- **Duplicated Efforts**: Different teams often perform the same research independently, wasting resources.
- **Information Gaps**: The manual nature of the process increases the risk of missing critical data or insights.

#### Solution Sought
An automated research tool that:

- Aggregates data from multiple reliable sources and centralizes the information.
- Summarizes key insights using AI, reducing manual searching time.
- Provides a unified repository for all teams to access up-to-date research, benchmarks, and trends.

#### Example Solution
An AI-powered research platform that:

- Scrapes data from trusted online sources (e.g., government databases, industry reports) and updates the repository automatically.
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key insights and create summaries.
- Enables fast and efficient searching without duplicating research efforts.

## üßë‚Äçüíº User Story: From the Perspective of Chapri Jackson aka tanas, a Company Employee

Hi, I‚Äôm Chapri Jackson aka tanas, a project manager in the Strategy Department. Here‚Äôs why we need this new system:

### Problem 1: Handling Internal Opinion Requests
**Current Issues:**

- There is no standard process, so each department responds differently (e.g., Word documents vs. emails), making consolidation difficult.
- We often duplicate work because there‚Äôs no centralized way to see who‚Äôs analyzing what.
- The quality of feedback varies, making it hard to make informed decisions.

**Why We Need a New System:**

A centralized platform would standardize responses, save time, and ensure consistent feedback. It should:

- Automate task assignments based on expertise.
- Provide templates for uniform responses.
- Allow us to access past analyses to prevent repeated work.

### Problem 2: Research and Benchmarking for Key Topics
**Current Issues:**

- I spend hours manually searching for data, and there‚Äôs no guarantee I‚Äôm finding the best information.
- My colleagues often perform the same research tasks, leading to wasted effort.
- Important data might be missed because it‚Äôs hard to keep track of all sources.

**Why We Need a New System:**

An automated tool would streamline research, save time, and provide us with comprehensive information. It should:

- Aggregate data automatically from multiple sources.
- Create a centralized knowledge base accessible to everyone.
- Use AI to summarize insights, reducing manual work and preventing duplication.

## üìà Benefits of the Proposed Solutions

- **Increased Efficiency**: Reduces the time spent on manual tasks and research.
- **Consistency**: Standardizes responses across departments, making it easier to compile and use feedback.
- **Better Decision-Making**: Provides reliable and complete information for informed decisions.
- **Reduced Duplication**: Centralized processes and knowledge sharing minimize repeated efforts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Choices

- **Automated Task Assignment**: Uses algorithms to assign requests based on departmental expertise.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For extracting and summarizing key insights from text data.
- **Centralized Knowledge Base**: Built with a searchable interface to store and access past analyses and research data.

## üíª Submission Requirements

- Submit an original MVP/prototype solution along with documentation by the deadline.
- Push the MVP/prototype to a GitHub repository and provide the link via the submission form.
- Include a `README.md` file with:
  - A description of the problem and solution.
  - The reasoning behind technical choices.
  - Instructions on how to build and/or run the project.
